# PDF Digital Signature Web App (RSA-PSS, Node.js)

Educational web application developed as part of a bachelor thesis in *Linguaggi e Tecnologie per il Web (ING-INF/05)*.  
The project explores **digital signatures for PDF documents** using **asymmetric cryptography (RSA-PSS)**, with a focus on **web security** and **cryptographic workflows**.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how **digital signatures** can be implemented in a web context by combining:
- theoretical concepts of **cryptography**
- practical **backend development** with Node.js
- secure workflows for **signing and verifying PDF documents**

The application was developed **for educational purposes** and is not intended for production use.

## Key Features

- Digital signing of PDF documents
- Signature verification process
- Use of **RSA-PSS** for asymmetric cryptography
- Clear separation between signing and verification workflows
- Backend-oriented architecture
